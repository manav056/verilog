## About
This repository is created to display my learning progress in the field of HDL programming using the Verilog HDL language. The contents of this repository have been segregated by file types. All the files were created using VS Code with open source verilog compiler Icarus-Verilog and the Vivado Software suite.

Other software packages like Intel Quartus Prime Lite were also utilized in some cases which will be marked appropriately.

## Standards Followed
All files in this repository broadly follow the 1364-2005 - IEEE Standard for Verilog Hardware Description Language.
